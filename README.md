Golang project training from Nana J

This repo is the result of following verbatim this tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I

## Background
This is a simple application written in Golang

This app captures users' name, email, and number of tickets they would like to reserve/purchase

This app uses threading, and controls main function to wait for child threads to complete before exiting.
(which is a touted benefit of Go)
